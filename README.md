Why? Because Puppeteer is cool. Also, helps working with data from various websites, collected in a human-looking way. 

Note: Wikipedia is only an example here. It's pointless to try to scrape it, all the data is downloadable!

Note: Uses only one tab to serially to run the searches to avoid spinning up tons of processes.
